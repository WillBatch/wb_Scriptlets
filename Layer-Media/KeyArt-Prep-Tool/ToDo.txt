Each layer needs to be in its own comp. That comp needs to match the deliverable comp size (tyically will be 4K)

Each layer needs to be set as a 3D layer. This includes all layers in pre-comps.

Each layer needs to enabled motion blur. Since we're using infinite rasterization, we can't apply motion blur on the root level of the comp,
so enabling it on each layer will enable motion blur

Add the zspace expression to each comp layer:
var camera = thisComp.layer("Camera 1");
var zoom=camera.cameraOption.zoom;
transform.scale*(1+transform.position[2]/zoom)
